# Bike-Sharing-Linear-Regression

This project was carried out as part of my Post Graduate Diploma in ML and AI in IITB

## Project Description
A bike-sharing system in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. It allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
